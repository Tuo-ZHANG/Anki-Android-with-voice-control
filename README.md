# Anki Android with voice control
I try to make only minimal changes to the original Anki Android while implementing the functionalities I want. Click the microphone icon the enable the voice control.

## Build
Please use Android studio bumblebee to build the project. Also consider to build the release apk instead of the debug apk as the debug version is quite slow.

## Supporting features
- [x] say "replay" to play the audio again
- [x] say "flip" to show the answer of the flashcard
- [x] say "again", "hard", "good" or "easy" to finish the current card and moves to the next card
- [x] say "undo" to undo the last card you have studied
- [ ] say "suspend" to suspend the current card
